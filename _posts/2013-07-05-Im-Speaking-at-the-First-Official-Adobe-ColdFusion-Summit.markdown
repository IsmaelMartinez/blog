I'm very pleased to announce that I have been asked to speak at [the first official Adobe ColdFusion Summit](http://cfsummit.adobeevents.com), which is being held in Las Vegas on October 24 - 25, 2013.

While the final session names haven't been announced, I can say that I'll be talking about Amazon Web Services (AWS) and ColdFusion. I gave talks about architecting highly available ColdFusion apps at both [NCDevCon](http://ncdevcon.com) and [cf.Objective](http://www.cfobjective.com) this year, and both talks included a lot of information about architecting for AWS.

The [Trello board for CF Summit session ideas](https://trello.com/board/cf-session-ideas/51b0fbeb94b2237145005a11) had two proposed sessions related to AWS and ColdFusion. "Cloud AWS & PaaS (possibly two topics)" and "VFS, File handling, CFHTTP, S3 (What is a file anyway?)" both made references to using ColdFusion with AWS, and my current plan is to try to pick from both cards for my talk. I think that a PaaS (platform as a service) comparison is probably way out of the scope of an hour-long session at the CF Summit, so my plan is to cover the following:

- AWS Overview
- S3 integration in ColdFusion
- The official CF10 AMI (quick setup and some caveats)
- A quick reference architecture for CF apps on AWS
- The reality of running production apps on AWS (gotchas)

I'd love to hear feedback about this. Would these topic areas interest you? Are you looking for something more advanced? Remember, I only have about 50 minutes for the entire session, and although I'm a fast talker, I can only cover so much!
