Another great NCDevCon happened this weekend in Raleigh. I really enjoy this conference &mdash; it's incredibly well-run &mdash; and look forward to returning next year.

Thank you again to everyone who attended my session and for all the great questions during the session. Here are the resources from my presentation "Start Using Amazon Web Services in Your ColdFusion Apps:"

It looks like the first minute of the recording of my presentation was cut off. I started at 10am according to my clock, but the MediaSite installation at the College of Textiles (which otherwise worked flawlessly), was a minute behind the rest of the world. You didn't miss anything important, I promise!
