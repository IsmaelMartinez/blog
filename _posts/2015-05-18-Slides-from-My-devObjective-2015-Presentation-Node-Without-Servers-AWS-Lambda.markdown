First let me thank everyone who came to my session at dev.Objective() on "Node without Servers: Event-Driven Computing with AWS Lambda." A lot of really great questions were asked and I had (another) great experience presenting at the conference.

Attached to this post is [a PDF of my slides from the presentation](/assets/pdf/devObjective2015-AWSLambda.pdf). The code shown in the presentation is also available from [my GitHub account](https://github.com/brianklaas/devObj2015-AWSLambda).

After the presentation, I came across two blog posts of interest:

The first shows [how to set up Lambda as a core service in the auditing of activities in AWS](http://blogs.aws.amazon.com/security/post/Tx2ZTUVN2VGBS85/How-to-Receive-Alerts-When-Specific-APIs-Are-Called-by-Using-AWS-CloudTrail-Amaz). I mentioned how you could use Lambda as an auditing service for S3 during my presentation. This example gives you a complete walk-through on how to do just that.

The second shows [how to use Lambda to respond to actions in a GitHub repo](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/dynamic-github-actions-with-aws-lambda). I had briefly mentioned this example during the presentation, so I thought I'd include it here!
