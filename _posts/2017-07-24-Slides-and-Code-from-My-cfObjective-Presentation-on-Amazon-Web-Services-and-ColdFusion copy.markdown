The [cf.Objective()](http://www.cfobjective.com/) conference is always an opportunity for me to learn from some of the smartest people in the CFML community. This year was no exception, and I'm grateful to the conference content committee for again inviting me to speak.

Attached to this post is a [PDF of the slides used in my presentation](/assets/pdf/cfObjective2017-LevelUpAppsWithAWS.pdf) "Level Up Your Web Apps with Amazon Web Services." The code that I used in the presentation can be found in [the GitHub repo for the AWS Playbox app](https://github.com/brianklaas/awsPlaybox/). There's a full set of instructions in the readme file on what you need to set up in AWS to get the app fully working.
