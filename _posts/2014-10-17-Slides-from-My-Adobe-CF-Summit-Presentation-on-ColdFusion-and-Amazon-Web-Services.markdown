Thanks to everyone who turned out for my presentation on using Amazon Web Services in ColdFusion 11 at the Adobe CF Summit in Las Vegas. [Attached to this post are my slides](/assets/pdf/CFSummit2014-CFandAWS.pdf).

If you have any questions about using AWS (with or without ColdFusion), feel free to get in touch with me and I'm happy to share what I know!
