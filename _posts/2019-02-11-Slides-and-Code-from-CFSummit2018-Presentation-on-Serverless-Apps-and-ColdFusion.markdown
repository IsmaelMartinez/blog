I just realized that never posted [the slides from my ColdFusion Summit 2018 presentation](/assets/pdf/CFSummit2018-StepIntoServerless.pdf) "Step Into Serverless with Amazon Web Services and ColdFusion." I'll be presenting an updated version of this presentation at the [ColdFusion Summit East 2019](http://carahevents.carahsoft.com/CFSummit2019/) this April.

It's been a very busy time for me lately &mdash; hence the dearth of posts. I am, however, pretty close to posting the next set in my series on using AWS from within CFML.

The code used in the presentation can be found in [the GitHub repo for the AWS Playbox app](https://github.com/brianklaas/awsPlaybox/). There's a full set of instructions in the readme file on what you need to set up in AWS to get the app fully working.
