This year's ColdFusion Summit conference was the best one yet. With a lot of new attendees (and people new to ColdFusion!), there was a great attitude and the sessions, overall, were very good. The customer showcase track, in which I spoke, was a great addition to the conference, and one I hope Adobe continues in future years.

Attached to this post are [the slides from my talk](/assets/pdf/CFSummit2016-AccessibleVideoWithAWS.pdf) "Accessible Video Anywhere with ColdFusion and AWS." I want to thank everyone who attended and asked some really great questions!
