Attached to this post is a [PDF of the slides used in my presentation](/assets/pdf/cfSummit2017-LevelUpAppsWithAWS.pdf) "Level Up Your CF Apps with Amazon Web Services." The code that I used in the presentation can be found in [the GitHub repo for the AWS Playbox app](https://github.com/brianklaas/awsPlaybox/). There's a full set of instructions in the readme file on what you need to set up in AWS to get the app fully working.
