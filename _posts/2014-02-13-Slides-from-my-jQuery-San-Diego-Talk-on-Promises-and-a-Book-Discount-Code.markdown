I want to offer my deepest gratitude to the entire [jQuery San Diego](http://events.jquery.org/2014/san-diego/) team for inviting me to speak at such an awesome conference. There are a lot of incredibly smart people speaking and attending the conference, which made my [impostor syndrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome) quite acute, but I was very proud to have been given an opportunity to present.

Attached to this post are [the slides from my talk "Promises, Promises: Unlocking the Power of jQuery's Deferreds."](/assets/pdf/jQueryPromisesAndDeferreds-jQuerySanDiego2014.pdf) The code from the presentation is available in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/brianklaas/jquerySD2014-promises).

I was also contacted just before the talk by Nicholas Tollervey and Terry Jones, the authors of [a new book from O'Reilly about promises and deferreds in jQuery](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920030508.do). The reviews thus far are quite good, and I'm reading the book now and so far I think it's a concise, clear, and very well-written piece on the topic.

The O'Reilly team has been generous enough to offer a promo code for the book. If you use the code AUTHD on [oreilly.com](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920030508.do), you'll get 40% off the print book and **50%** off the ebook!
