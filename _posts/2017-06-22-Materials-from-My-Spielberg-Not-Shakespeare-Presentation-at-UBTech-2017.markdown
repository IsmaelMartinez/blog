I always enjoy the [UBTech conference](http://www.ubtechconference.com). It's an interesting mix of instructional technologists, faculty, administrative deans, and senior IT staff. The sessions are diverse as well, and I always learn quite a bit.

I presented the latest version of my "Spielberg, Not Shakespeare" talk at the conference. Additionally, [the team at Sonic Foundry did a really nice write up of my talk](http://www.sonicfoundry.com/designing-youtube-generation-flipping-classroom/). You can also [see a recording of the entire presentation](https://ubtech.mediasite.com/mediasite/Showcase/ubtech17/Presentation/486e4844feac4cbfaac34e8b0de59e631d). If you don't want to watch the whole presentation, the write up is a really good alternative.

I've also attached my slides from the presentation to this post, which you can download [here](/assets/pdf/ShakespeareSpielbergYouTube-UBTech2017.pdf).
