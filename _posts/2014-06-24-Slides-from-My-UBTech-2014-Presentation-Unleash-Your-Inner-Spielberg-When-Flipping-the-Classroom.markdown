I was asked to speak again this year at [UBTech](http://www.ubtechconference.com). It's an interesting educational technology conference with a pretty diverse audience of faculty, instructional staff and senior-level administrators. I always get a lot out of the conference, and this year was no different.

Attached to this post is a [PDF version of the slides from my presentation "Unleash Your Inner Spielberg When Flipping the Classroom."](/assets/pdf/InnerSpielberg-UBTech2014.pdf) It was another good presentation, with great follow-up from a number of attendees.

This was my favorite tweet about the presentation:
