Thanks to the amazing [Charlie Arehart](http://www.carehart.org) for hosting me on last week's [CFMeetup](https://www.meetup.com/coldfusionmeetup/). My presentation &mdash; "I Didn't Know S3 Could Do That!" &mdash; covered a lot of the same material that is in [my recent series on using S3 in CFML](http://brianklaas.net/aws/coldfusion/2020/05/06/New-Series-Using-S3-in-CFML.html). There were a lot of really good questions, and I very much enjoyed my time delivering the presentation.

You can [download the slides](https://brianklaas.net.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/assets/pdf/CFMeetupAug2020-S3.pdf) from the presentation, or [watch the whole presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNcOfG9Vkbg&list=PLG2EHzEbhy0-QirMKgSxhjkUyTSSTvHjL) on YouTube.
