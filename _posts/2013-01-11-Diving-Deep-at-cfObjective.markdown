I'm honored to have been selected to speak at this year's [cf.Objective()](http://www.cfobjective.com/) conference. I got the opportunity to speak for the first time at cf.Objective() last year, and this year, the good people on the content selection committee asked if I'd do a deep dive on my proposed topic: [Making Your ColdFusion Apps Highly Available](http://www.cfobjective.com/sessions/deepdivemaking-your-coldfusion-apps-highly-available/).

The full sessions description and outline is at the link above. However, that description and outline were written before the topic was selected as a deep dive session (which runs for two hours instead of one). I do plan on adding a bit more, including information on:

- monitoring options for the local cluster
- using a message queue (ie; RabbitMQ/ActiveMQ) in your architecture<
- separation of services to ensure availability when one service (ie; PDF generation, custom reporting, email) fails. This is particularly important for AWS/cloud deployment.
- moving existing apps to the cloud vs. building cloud-native apps

Once I get the outline finalized, I'll try to get it updated on the cf.Objective() site.

Anyway, thanks again to the cf.Objective() conference team. I can't wait!
