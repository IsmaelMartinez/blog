You don't have to look much further than the relevant tweets and blog posts to know that the first official CF Summit was a great success. It was awesome to be a part of this inaugural event, and I certainly hope that I get the opportunity to give a presentation next year. 

Attached to this post are [the slides from my presentation "Start Using Amazon Web Services in Your ColdFusion Apps."](/assets/pdf/StartUsingAWSinYourCFApps-Klaas.pdf) I know I went pretty quickly (one tweet described it as "drinking from a firehose"), but I actually felt like everyone kept up and was really satisfied with what I covered. With the slide deck, you can now check out all the resources I pointed to during the presentation. You can also find the presentation slides in the [Dropbox folder for CF Summit 2013 speakers](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ro475gjwcywjg9k/Pekly_5P_o)
