First off, a huge thanks the entire [Ortus Solutions](https://www.ortussolutions.com/) team for hosting the very fun [Into the Box conference](http://intothebox.org/). Though small in total size, the conference had a lot of really good, higher level sessions about CFML and Web apps in general. The Ortus team really is making great tools for the CFML community.

Attached to this post are [a copy of the slides from my presentation](/assets/pdf/intoTheBox2017-LevelUpAppsWithAWS.pdf) "Level Up Your Web Apps with Amazon Web Services." [The git repo that accompanies this presentation](https://github.com/brianklaas/intothebox2017) contains the same code examples that I showed during the presentation, along with a bonus demo of Simple Notification Service (SNS).

Thanks again to everyone who attended the session!
