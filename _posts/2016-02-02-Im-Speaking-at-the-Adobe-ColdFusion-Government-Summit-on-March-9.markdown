In addition to the ColdFusion Summit in Las Vegas, Adobe has this year decided to hold a one-day, government (well, DC-area) specific conference. The [Adobe ColdFusion Government Summit is on March 9, 2016 in Washington, DC](http://blogs.coldfusion.com/post.cfm/adobe-coldfusion-government-summit-washington-d-c-march-9th). I'm one of three non-Adobe employees who has been asked to speak at the conference, so I'm both excited and thankful to the Adobe ColdFusion team for the opportunity.

I'll be speaking about caching in ColdFusion along with performance enhancements made around caching (specifically, using Redis as a session storage cache) in Adobe ColdFusion 2016, the forthcoming release of the product. I've spoken about the crazy simple, crazy powerful caching tools in ColdFusion in the past, so I hope to show attendees how simple it is to vastly speed up performance in ColdFusion apps by using simple caching techniques.

If your'e in the DC/NoVA/Maryland area, the event is free and open to anyone, not just government employees. Space is limited to 50 people, so if you haven't yet registered, [now is definitely the time to do so](http://blogs.coldfusion.com/post.cfm/adobe-coldfusion-government-summit-washington-d-c-march-9th).
