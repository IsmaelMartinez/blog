I really enjoyed presenting at dev.Objective() again this year. In spite of a projector disaster at the beginning of the session, I thought the talk went surprisingly well. The audience asked a lot of great attendance, and I was thankful that so many people showed up and waited patiently for the projector issues to get resolved.

The [slides from my presentation in PDF format](/assets/pdf/devObjective2016-AWSAppPower.pdf) are attached to this post. 

You can [view the GitHub repo for the demo app that I was using](https://github.com/brianklaas/devObjective2016) as well. There's a full set of instructions for getting the demo app up and running in the repo.

Go play with AWS. I'm sure that there's at least one service (or more!) which will help you build better, more powerful web apps!
