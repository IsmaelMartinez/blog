The organizers of this year's cf.Objective() had the brilliant idea of setting up a [shared Dropbox folder](http://cfml.us/98) for the slides, code, and supporting materials from all sessions at the conference. I've posted a PDF of my slides from my session, "Making Your ColdFusion Apps Highly Available," to [this Dropbox folder](http://cfml.us/98). The PDF includes links to a lot of the tools, services, and articles that I referenced in my talk.

Thanks again to everyone who attended, and for the excellent questions and feedback I've received after the session.

Based on some of the questions I've received, I think I'm going to put in a conference proposal next year to talk about Amazon S3 and CloudFront, and how amazingly simple they are to use in ColdFusion!
