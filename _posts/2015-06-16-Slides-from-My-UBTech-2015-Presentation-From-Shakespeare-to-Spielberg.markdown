Attached to this post are [my slides for the presentation I gave at UBTech 2015 today](/assets/pdf/ShakespeareSpielbergYouTube-UBTech2015.pdf): "From Shakespeare to Spielberg: Designing for the YouTube Generation When Flipping the Classroom."

This presentation, like so many others that I've given, was the culmination of a lot of hard work and a lot of good learning in the process. I posted this on Twitter the other day, and I think it's a deep truth about lifelong learning:

I really like presenting at UBTech. I always learn a lot about current best practices and lessons learned in higher education at the conference itself, and I learn a lot getting ready to present.

If you're interested in me giving this talk at your institution, please let me know!
