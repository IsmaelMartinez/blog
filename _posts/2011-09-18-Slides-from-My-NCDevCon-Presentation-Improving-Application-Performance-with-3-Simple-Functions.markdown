For those of you who wanted my slides from my presentation at NCDevCon &mdash; Improving Application Performance with 3 Simple Functions &mdash; they're [attached to this post](/assets/pdf/ImproveAppPerformance-NCDC2011.pdf). As usual, I learned a lot about what would work and would not work while practicing this presentation, and was making changes just an hour before showtime. I received some good feedback from a couple of people in the session as well, and wanted to extend my thanks to everyone who attended the session.

[NCDevCon](http://www.ncdevcon.com/) has turned out to be a really good conference with a number of interesting sessions. A couple of sessions that I wanted to see are running concurrently, which is bad for me but, I think, always the sign of a good conference!
