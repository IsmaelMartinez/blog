This year's [UBTech conference](http://www.ubtechconference.com) was another very good mix of technology and pedagogy. I had the pleasure of attending with one of my colleagues from [the Bloomberg School of Public Health](http://www.jhsph.edu/) this year, and we both took away a lot of valuable lessons.

I presented "You Are Your Own Spielberg: What We Can Learn from YouTube When Flipping the Classroom" at the conference. [The slides from the presentation](/assets/pdf/ShakespeareSpielbergYouTube-UBTech2018.pdf) are attached to this post.
